## User Story

AS A USER

	I WANT to be able to track my daily activity, physical health records,  
       and notes on mental health with access to classes, videos, and 
       other resources 
       
SO THAT

	I can reflect back on how I was feeling on certain days, what part of 
        my day may have been a stressor, and what activities I enjoyed doing
	
SO THEN
	
	I can access new resources similar to my interests
